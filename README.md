# Word-Indexer
In this project I built a multi-threaded search engine which takes the path to a directory as input via command line, and searches all the files and sub-directories inside that directory. It returns the list of words which appear maximum number of times, minimum number of times or all the words depending upon the input attribute in all the files combined.
